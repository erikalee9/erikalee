I am a hydrologist currently working on obtaining my M.S. in Watershed Science at Colorado State University. My research focuses on the effects of fire on snowpack and I am examining whether these effects impact the energy budget in post-fire landscapes. I have a background in pre- and post-fire environmental consulting, specializing in hazard assessments, mitigation projects and environmental planning.

Interests:

-   Hydrologic effects of wildfire on mountainous watersheds

-   Ecogeomorphology

-   Conservation

-   Environmental consulting

Education:

-   M.S. Candidate in Watershed Science

    Colorado State University, 2023-present

-   B.A. Environmental Studies

    Prescott College, 2017-2019

-   A.S. Natural Sciences

    Sierra College, 2016-2017
